  C3 Guide is a guide to the C3 Programming Language. It is a work in progress, and will be continually updated.
</p>

## What is C3?
<p>C3 is a system programming language based on C.</p>
It is an evolution of C enabling the same paradigms and retaining the same syntax as far as possible.

C3 started as an extension of the [C2 language](https://www.c2lang.org/) by [Bas van den Berg](https://github.com/bvdberg). It has evolved significantly,
not just in syntax but also in regard to error handling, macros, generics and strings.

The C3 compiler can be found on github: https://github.com/c3lang/c3c.

Binaries (c3 6.1) are directly downloadable for the following platforms:
  - Windows x64 [download](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/v0.6.1/c3-windows.zip), [install instructions](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c#installing-on-windows-with-precompiled-binaries).
  - Debian  x64 [download](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/v0.6.1/c3-linux.tar.gz), [install instructions](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c#installing-on-debian-with-precompiled-binaries).
  - MacOS   x64 [download](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/v0.6.1/c3-macos.zip), [install instructions](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c#installing-on-mac-with-precompiled-binaries).

# Features
  - Full C ABI compatibility
  - Module system
  - Generic modules
  - Design by contract
  - Zero overhead errors
  - Semantic macro system
  - First-class SIMD vector types
  - Struct subtyping
  - Safe array access using slices
  - Easy to use inline assembly
  - Cross-platform standard library which includes dynamic containers and strings
  - LLVM backend

# Design principles
  - Procedural “get things done”-type of language.
  - Stay close to C - only change where there is a significant need.
  - Flawless C integration.
  - Learning C3 should be easy for a C programmer.
  - Dare add conveniences if the value is great.
  - Data is inert and zero is initialization.
  - Avoid “big ideas”.
  - Avoid the kitchen sink language trap.
